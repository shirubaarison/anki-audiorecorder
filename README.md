I created this to automate the process of creating new japanese vocab cards in Anki using mainly visual novels, that's why it records audio and takes a screenshot. In the end, I decided to just dualboot windows anyway so I can use Yomitan to add new cards to anki, Textractor to hook the texts from the game and ShareX to screenshot and record audio. Maybe I will update this to use with other things like youglish idk

probably only works on my enviroment (sry) (arch linux, pipewire-pulse, gnome, xorg)

pls check scripts/settings.py 

you need to add a audio loopback device and set it as default, check out setup.py in utils to see it how I do it
